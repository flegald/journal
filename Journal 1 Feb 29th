Great start to the class. getting everyone's environment set up was a big help so the whole class can move on. 
      The most interesting thing to me about today was installing iPython. It is awesome to see and mess around with python in a live enviroment. I think I will find myself here a lot testing ideas and what not. The most confusing thing was the virtual environment. It is not as straight forward as iPython and am curious to see how it works more. Did not learn any new actual Python today but I know that was not the point, getting set up was.

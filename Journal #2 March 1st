  I really got a feel for what the virtual environment does today. I was unsure 
  yesterday, but using it with pytest today was a great way to really get
  a feel for it. The lecture on it was also very good. Informative and
  instructive. The actual module we created today was also very interesting.
  I came up with a way to solve it very quickly, but my partner wanted to 
  tackle it a different way, so it was neat to see how many different ways one can
  complete a task. This was one of thefirst times in paried programming where my
  ideas were so different from my partners, as well as the tools we used to get the
  task done. So working with the differences was the biggest lesson for me today.
  A question I have then, while working in a professional environment, is there a
  standard that is used for people working in the same team? Specifically, the
  programs and tools used so that there is a good cohesion throughout the team?
